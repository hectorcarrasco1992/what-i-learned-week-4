# **FUN-ctions with Return Value and Parameters!!**
    *learned about functions with Parameters
        * Function add(PARAMETER){PARAMETER = PARAMETER +1}
          * the _parameter_ is what the function is pertaining to and whatever you call it when writing the function is just a place holder for when you actually call the function.
          * add(5) will get you 6.


    * Returns- Define the value 
      * Function add(x){
            x=x+1
            return x
  
        }
        *this lets the result become back as whatever value x would be. If return was not there, the result would be undefined.


# Return of the String
    * did an exercise where we practiced how to use return values to further cement our basic knowledge of them and how they work within a function.
